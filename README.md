## ‚ú®  What is Reachability Analysis?

Reachability analysis is concerned with computing rigorous approximations of the set
of states reachable by a dynamical system. In the scope of this package are systems
modeled by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with uncertain initial states,
uncertain parameters or non-deterministic inputs. The package also considers the
extension to so-called hybrid systems where the dynamics changes with discrete events.
