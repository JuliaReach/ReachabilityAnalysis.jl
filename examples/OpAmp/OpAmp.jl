# Operational amplifiers ("op-amp") are electronic devices to amplify an input
# voltage signal. They are widely used to construct filters that remove a
# desired range of frequencies from the input signal.
#
# The schematic diagram of an op-amp has two terminals:
# - input terminal (left)
# - output terminal (right)
#
# The output voltage is ``e_{out} = K(e_B - e_A)``, where ``K`` is the voltage
# gain of the op-amp, which is usually very large (at the order of
# ``10^5 V / V``).
#
# In the *ideal op-amp* scenario, the following assumptions hold:
# - The input terminals of the op-amp draw negligible current.
# - The voltage difference at the input terminals ``e_B - e_A`` is zero.
# - The gain ``K`` is infinite.

# ## Inverting amplifier

# Consider the following circuit, which consists of an ideal op-amp in the
# so-called inverting configuration.

# ![](opamp_c.png)

# It is not hard to show [Kluever20](@cite) that the output satisfies the following
# differential equation:
#
# ```math
#    \dfrac{d e_{out}(t)}{dt} = -\dfrac{1}{R_2 C}e_{out}(t) - \dfrac{1}{R_1C}e_{in}(t).
# ```
#
# The circuit exhibits a transient behavior because of the capacitor connected
# in parallel to the op-amp. In the stationary limit ``t → ∞``,
# ``\dfrac{d e_{out}(t)}{dt} = 0`` and ``e_{out} = - \dfrac{R_2}{R_1} e_{in}``.
# The gain is thus ``-\dfrac{R_2}{R_1}`` and the minus sign is the reason that
# this circuit is called "inverting amplifier."
#
# The output voltage ``e_{out}(t)`` depends on the input voltage ``e_{in}(t)``.
# In order to highlight some typical assumptions on the inputs, in the rest of
# this notebook we model the input voltage in different ways:
#
#  1. **Nondeterministic input** with bounded range. This is the most general
#     case, in which ``e_{in}(t) ∈ E_{in}``, with ``E_{in} ⊆ \mathbb{R}`` is
#     an interval for the set of admissible inputs. This approach guarantees
#     that the flowpipe covers all possible trajectories for any bounded and
#     measurable function ``e_{in}(t)`` satisfying the constraint
#     ``e_{in}(t) ∈ E_{in}`` for all ``t`` of the given time span.
#
#  2. **Constant input**, a special case such that ``e_{in}(t) ∈ E_{in}`` and
#     ``e_{in}(t)`` is *constant* along trajectories.
#
#  3. **Time-varying input** such that the input is determined by a (possibly
#     time-varying) predefined function ``e_{in}(t)`` that is given by the
#     solution of some differential equation. In particular, we consider linear
#     and exponential input functions.
#
# In the following sections, we will consider these three different scenarios.

# ## Nondeterministic input

# In this section, we assume that the input voltage ``e_{in}(t)`` can be any
# (measurable) function whose range is contained in the set ``E_{in}``.

# ### Model

# It is convenient to define constants ``α`` and ``β`` such that
# ``\dfrac{d e_{out}(t)}{dt} = α e_{out}(t) + β e_{in}(t)``.

# ## Constant input

# In this section, we model the input voltage ``e_{in}(t)`` with a family of
# differential equations of the form
# ``\dfrac{d e_{in}(t)}{dt} = γ e_{in}(t) + δ``.

# ### Model

# There are two distinct behaviors depending on the parameters ``γ`` and ``δ``:
#
#  - ``γ = δ = 0``: the input is constant, ``e_{in}(t) = e_{in, 0}``.
#  - ``γ = 0``, ``δ ≠ 0``: the input is given by linear with rate ``δ``,
#    ``e_{in}(t) = δ t + e_{in, 0}``.
#  - ``γ ≠ 0``, ``δ ≠ 0``: the input is exponential with rate ``γ``,
#    ``e_{in}(t) = (e_{in, 0} + δ / γ)e^{γ t} - δ / γ``.
#
# Moreover, it is natural to assume that the input saturates at a given
# threshold value. The following function, `opamp_with_saturation`, models the
# system as a hybrid automaton with two modes: in the first mode, the input
# signal ``e_{in}(t)`` varies according to the specified dynamics, and in the
# second mode, the input signal saturates and ceases to increase (or decrease,
# depding on the signs chosen). Observe that there are now two state dimensions.
# The first coordinate corresponds to the output ``e_{out}(t)``, while the
# second coordinate, ``e_{in}(t)``, corresponds to the input signal
# ``e_{in}(t)``.
#
# In this section, we consider the constant input scenario:
# ``e_{in}(0) ∈ E_{in, 0}``, ``e_{in}(t)`` constant and ``γ = δ = 0``. We will
# consider the other cases in the next section.
