## Modeling uncertain inputs

In this section of the manual we consider systems with linear continuous dynamics

```math
x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t),\qquad x(0) âˆˆ X_0,\qquad (1)
```
where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, $x(t) \in X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$,
$B \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ and $u(t) \in U \in \mathbb{R}^m$.
Systems with mixed discrete/continuous dynamics of type (1) are discussed
in the section [hybrid_systems](@ref).

Generally, we distinguish between three types of inputs:

1. Fixed inputs, where $u(t)$ is precisely known. In some cases, $u(t)$ is a constant;
   in other cases, it is a function specified by the user.
