# Parametric reachability

## Theory

Parametric reachability consist of . . . 

## Example

We reconsider the example from Section (REF?), but we add an uncertain parameter $Î±$ that accounts for the variation in the ...


## Spring-mass system

Here we consider variations in the constant $k$ and perform reachability . . . .
