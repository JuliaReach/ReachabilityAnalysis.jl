# Parametric reachability

## Theory

Parametric reachability consist of . . .

## Example

We reconsider the example from Section (REF?), but we add an uncertain parameter $Î±$ that accounts for the variation in the ...


## Spring-mass system

Here we consider variations in the constant $k$ and perform reachability . . . .


## Example



### Problem formulation

Solution process

To illustrate the solution process, we consider a spring-mass system illustrated in the following figure.

The mass is $m$ and the elastic constant of the spring is $k$.

### Solving the initial-value problem

In this case the system is not given as a set of first-order ODEs, so we will make that transformation as a first step.

Transforming higher-order into a first-order system.

Formulating the mathematical problem involves writing the system as a first-order

### Analyzing the solution

## Spring-mass system

In the following example we consider a spring-mass system which is a linear ODE
with two-degrees of freedom.

In this section we show how to solve initial value problems with sets of initial
conditions. First we consider the simple *scalar* equation $x'(t) = -x(t)$,
where $x(0)$ may be any point in a given initial interval $\mathcal{X}_0$.
Then we consider the [spring-mass system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_harmonic_motion#Examples),
a second order linear ODE studied in introductory physics courses. For that system
we show an example of how to compute and project the flowpipe, and then plot the
variables of interest.
