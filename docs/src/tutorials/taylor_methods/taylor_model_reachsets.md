# Taylor model reach-sets

In this section we introduce Taylor models reach-sets, a representation that is used in Taylor-model based reachability algorithms.
The representation as well as the algorithms are implemented in the Julia package [TaylorModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/TaylorModels.jl);
`ReachabilityAnalysis.jl` provides a unified interface as well as methods to convert from Taylor models to other set representations and vice-versa.
