# [Bibliography](@id all_ref)

This page includes references to the scientific works that we have applied
throughout this library. Although the list is not meant to be exhaustive, we think
it should give a solid starting place for those who want to explore further.

If you use [ReachabilityAnalysis.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReach/ReachabilityAnalysis.jl) for your own work, please consider citing the
appropriate original reference(s). We provide the BibTeX entries in each case.

If you find that a reference here is missing, if you spot a typo or want to update
a reference, do not hesitate to contact us by email, or open an issue. Sorting is alphabetic.
